Changelog:
- modernsongticker in shade mode just needed the correct layout id ;) (normal2)
- Wrote a startup script for the animation
- Wrote a beatvis script for the uhh.. beatvis ;)
- Wrote a script for the volume buttons... you can use that script as is in normal mode too... just remember to use same id's
- The layers of the player was change a little... think its better now. The seeker background still needs the same bg all around or something.
- smaller other stuff (shade min,close,switch)

- Muse we force dta? (havent done this before but afaik it possible).. this will be recommended if shade is resizeable.

- Since the playlist wont have that bg anymore... what do you think if we spice it up with the playlist search xui as found in the latest cpro beta?


Here are some more notes:
-------------------------------
OK some notes

Shade mode not resizable
@## Do you want it resizeable?

I will create sobieski button soon.

playlist we need to find out how i put in an image in the past.
@## Already made a playlist copy via maki but I'm afriad somewhere down the line the transparent list thing dont work so good anymore. Someone probably broke it again at Nullsoft. The list itself also dont have something good to show what song is currently playing... so this means that we can have a decent list with the bg. Really dissapointed about this, but this is the limitations we have skinning in winamp ;).... Its about time they create some sort of file we can use to have backgrounds in playlists.

I put in an animation with the words Impressfera but it seems to skip? the png is ok dont know why,, 
 Whats going on. hit F5 if you missed it.
@## I replaced the animation with a maki generated one ;)... the alpha fades looks way better this way.

Also I put in a custom vis in the middle tribe symbol- red pulses
@## I also replaced this with a maki one... better alpha fades. There are two pics for this and for the above animation. You can change it if you dont like the current ones... just put something in there to get started with ;)

still working on EQ and adding buttons.  I will clean it up to make it look good when all the hard stuff is out of the way.


Also seeker has to be 360 maybe meeting right center on the top.  the second ring i made darker
for the underneath layer.
@## Read this a little late. See what I've done and if you dont like it we can do the 360 one. Just note that a 360 seeker will be less user friendly because you it will jump quickly from 0% to 100%

Also he paid me $200 for first part of skin, when ever you give me $ instructions I will send

$225
