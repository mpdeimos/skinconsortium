Will we have two links clickable? The Impressfera goes to the .pl website he send you...
and the sobieski bottle label goes to there http://www.vodkasobieski.com/ website?

You can just put the button there... I'll write the script to open the container and navigate to the website.
Will the default website(if webbrowser is openned manually) be the .pl site?

What else must still be done

BTw... the new stuff looks great! The eq is very sleek. Just one problem I see.. the preamp needs alignment with the other sliders.. looks very odd atm ;)... maybe I must add a quick fade on hover for the eq sliders too?

Theres also minor gfx stuff yet to be done... like tooltips... and colors that I might have missed.

Will also create a quick about screen for the prefs... maybe just give me a small png that says... designed by sc... with a logo or something (thats if we're alowed to do that ;)... will just be in the prefs > moderns skins > about

Anything I've missed?
