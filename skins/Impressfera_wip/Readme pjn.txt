search XUI is fine  not alot of time 2 days left to hand it to them.

I have a long day tomorrow at work 6am start

I worked alot on this tonight but forgot the Browser button and the Vol and EQ on the Main mode



Did th New EQ Looks Better!

Finished Shade Mode! I think.




Everything you did works great and your animation looks way better!

I guess you can do what you want tomorrow.  not much now -- we need to test with other people.
