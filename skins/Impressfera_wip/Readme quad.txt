Changed:
- 3state repeat (the user can see the newstip to see what is going on... Repeat: Track, ...)
- xml cleanup ;)
- Added winamp browser with default homepage http://www.vodkasobieski.com/
- Seeker looks/work better now
- close/winshade/min button is now implemented (same gfx as the generic frames)
- tooltip gfx added (must still edit the gfx though ;)

Quad can u create a button for the Sobieski name on the bottle bottom?
Just create the button and I'll add the code for it to open the browser with their website.

Also when you start with player bg gfx, can you maybe put some shade behind the impressfera letters? That I can be seen on a light desktop ;)

Dont think that middle layer is needed anymore... it can be bundled with the main middle overlay. The seeker can be trimmed better... you should see I made a attempt to trim it down to the actual visible parts.

What do you have planned for the shade mode? Will it be resizeable? Will it have alpha blending?

One more thing.. the playlist. I see they want a background. This isnt possible with the normal playlist. How ever I can create a copy of the original a using wasabi lists that can then have that image as a background. Can then just include a toggle button to switch from the cool looking playlist to the classic playlist(with more functions). What do you think? Transparent lists havent been used in Winamp skins yet so that would look really nice ;)
