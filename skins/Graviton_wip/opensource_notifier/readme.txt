"OpenSource" Notifier - by Jared Kole (iplaythespoons@hotmail.com)

How to use:

1)  Add the opensource_notifier folder to your skin's directory
2)  Add "<include file="opensource_notifier/notifier.xml" />" to your skin.xml

You may notice the prefrences window added to the right click menu.  It can be removed from the right click menu by changing the nomenu= param in the notifier's container.  It should be pretty easy with some knowledge of maki to move those prefrences to sliders within the skin.  If you need help, email me any time.
